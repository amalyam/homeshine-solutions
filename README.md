www.homeshinesolutions.com was built with: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [MUI](https://mui.com/). It was deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and makes use of [Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/apis), [SparkPost API](https://www.sparkpost.com/), and [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) image carousel. It was made in collaboration with the founder of HomeShine Solutions, LLC. In building this website, I also provided graphic design and copywriting services for the logo and text.

- Google Cloud API was used for storing the contact form submission data in a Google Sheet
- SparkPost API was used to send a copy of the contact form responses to the user and to the owner of the company
